# google-homepage
An Odin Project recreation of the Google Homepage
This was my first real project with The Odin Project.
Overall it was a little frustrating at first until it clicked how to best put things together. 
I think I became a little impatient with the relative sizes of things, which is why they might be a little off.
I used images instead of creating new files which I think might be cheating but I hope it's acceptable. Haha.
The sizes of some of the text are off and I need to learn how to fix them. I think it's something I can work on in the future.
